                        <p>On the Indonesian island of Ternate, clove farmers face a new threat: climate change.
                            Unpredictable
                            rainfall and extreme weather are impacting yields, causing financial strain and forcing
                            farmers to seek
                            alternative incomes. While Indonesia remains a major clove producer, fluctuating prices and
                            declining
                            harvests jeopardize a historical legacy, urging global attention to climate issues.
                            The impact of climate change on clove farmers in Ternate highlights the vulnerability of
                            small-scale agriculture to environmental shifts. Rising temperatures and altered
                            precipitation patterns threaten not only the livelihoods of farmers but also the cultural
                            heritage tied to clove production. Efforts to adapt and mitigate these effects are crucial
                            to preserving Indonesia's clove industry and supporting the communities that depend on it.
                            Sustainable practices, climate-resilient farming techniques, and diversified income sources
                            could help farmers cope with these challenges. Additionally, global market support and fair
                            trade practices might alleviate financial strain, enabling clove farmers to maintain their
                            traditional way of life amidst the changing climate.

                        <p>Saurabh Popli, who works on environmental issues and is also an Associate Professor at the
                            School of

                            significant
                            implications for human societies and ecosystems.He emphasized the need for collective action
                            to mitigate the effects of climate change, highlighting the importance of sustainable
                            practices, renewable energy, and environmentally conscious policies. The conversation also
                            touched upon the role of individuals, communities, and governments in addressing the climate
                            crisis and promoting a greener future. By engaging diverse stakeholders, the initiative aims
                            to foster a culture of climate awareness and inspire meaningful change.</p>
